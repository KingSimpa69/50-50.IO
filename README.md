# 50-50.IO

Welcome to **50-50.IO**, a decentralized, permissionless, and trustless platform designed to securely facilitate 50/50 fundraisers online. This innovative application operates on the Flux Network and Coinbaseâ€™s Layer-2 scaling solution "Base", leveraging decentralized computing services to offer a fully-fledged WEB3 application.

**Key Features:**
- **Decentralized:** Running completely on Base Layer-2 and the Flux Network, utilizing optimistic rollups and native Flux Proof of Work to power an ecosystem of high-availability compute power, governed transparently on-chain.
- **Enhanced Security:** Leveraging the blockchain's secure consensus mechanisms, future block hashes are used for selecting winning tickets, ensuring fairness and unpredictability. Unlike Ethereum, where future block hashes can be susceptible to miner manipulations, the optimistic rollups technology on Base L2 ensures that future block hashes are unpredictable and tamper-proof.
- **Permissionless & Trustless:** All operations, from deployment to conducting raffles, are managed through secure, on-chain smart contracts without any centralized ownership.

50-50.IO ensures that every transaction and operation is transparent, secure, and governed by the immutable rules set by the blockchain, making it an ideal platform for conducting fair and equitable fundraisers globally.
